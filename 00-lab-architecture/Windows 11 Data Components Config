### 2.1 Normal SMB Usage

- **Source:** Windows 10 → **Destination:** Windows Server
- Typical pattern:
  - A small number of connections from one client to one server.
  - SMB session setup, tree connect, file operations, then teardown.
- Observed fields:
  - Source IP: `...`
  - Dest IP: `...`
  - Dest port: 445
  - Auth user: `labuser1`

### 2.2 Suspicious / Scan-like Behavior

- **Source:** Kali → multiple hosts
- Pattern:
  - Many SMB session setup attempts in quick succession across multiple IPs.
  - Some failed auth, some succeeded.
- Signs of lateral movement / reconnaissance:
  - High fan-out (1 → many hosts).
  - Repeated authentication attempts by same user to many targets.
