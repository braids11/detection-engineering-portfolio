## MITRE ATT&CK Defender Training Notes

This folder contains my personal notes from working through the MAD20.io MITRE ATT&CK Defender training courses. I take detailed, well-structured notes because I find writing them out in this way helps me understand and retain the material.

The notes are written in my own words and reflect my understanding of the course material. They’re shared here as part of my cybersecurity portfolio to show what I have learned, especially since training badges expire after 12 months.
