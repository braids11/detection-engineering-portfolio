## 1.3 Framing An Assessment

![](./images/process-frame-assessment.png)

When you **should** and **shouldn't** run an assessment

Know how to ensure SOCs **understand** and **want** an assessment.

| Myth | Reality | Summary |
|-----|--------|---------|
| Running an ATT&CK-based SOC assessment does not mean you have operationalised ATT&CK | Assessment is a one-time snapshot and glimpse into ATT&CK coverage | **Assessments ≠ ATT&CK Adoption** |
| Results are accurate and can be relied upon for a long time | Assessment is a snapshot in time | **Results are time-bound** |
| Assessment = Improved Security | Requires acting on recommendations | **Assessment only ≠ Improved Security** |
| Identifies specific gaps in coverage | Broad strokes – indication where gaps may exist | **Identifies areas for improvement, not specifics** |
