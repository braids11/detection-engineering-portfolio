My MITRE ATT&amp;CK Detection Strategies Portfolio

# Detection Engineering Portfolio  
*A hands-on lab-driven exploration of MITRE ATT&CK and MITRE CAR analytics.*

This repository contains my personal detection engineering lab, where I:
- Build and run a virtual detection lab
- Reproduce adversary behavior from MITRE ATT&CK
- Implement and document MITRE CAR analytics
- Capture and analyze network/host telemetry
- Develop detection logic (Sigma, KQL, SPL, EQL, Zeek scripts)
- Produce detailed writeups, evidence, and tuning notes

## 🔬 Lab Overview

I am building a full detection lab using:
- Mac Mini 2018 running ESXi
- Windows 10 endpoint
- Windows Server
- Kali Linux attacker
- Sysmon + Windows Event Logging
- (Optional) Zeek, Elastic, or Splunk

The lab will evolve as I complete more analytics and experiments.
